# Monitoring of ANSPs cash and liquidity situation {#sec-covid}

This chapter provides an overview of ANSPs' financial situation over the {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}} - {{< var doc.year_report >}} period, using two indicators: the current ratio and the cash-on-hand days. These indicators have been calculated at pan-European system level using the information provided in the ANSPsâ€™ Financial Statements which were available at the time of publishing this report (34 for the 2017-2021 period and 18 in 2022). The indicators are therefore consistent with those published at individual ANSP level in the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Unit [ANSPs Financial Dashboard](https://ansperformance.eu/economics/finance/).

Depending on the organisational set up of different ANSPs, the information reported in their financial statements covers a different scope of activities (e.g. it may include airport management operations, commercial activities, etc.) which does not always correspond with the ACE gate-to-gate scope. Additionally, due to specific organisational and financial set up, DCAC Cyprus, HASP, LVNL and MUAC, are excluded from the analysis presented in this chapter.

@fig-figure-5-1 presents the changes in the average current ratio between {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}} and {{< var doc.year_report >}} as well as the 1st and 3rd quartiles. The current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term debt obligations with its current assets. On average, the situation slightly improved in {{< var doc.year_report >}} following four years of continuous deterioration.

@fig-figure-5-2 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}} - {{< var doc.year_report >}} period as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. The cash-on-hand days indicator (cash & cash equivalents divided by operating costs x 365) measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.

In {{< var doc.year_report >}}, the average cash-on-hand days amounted to 145 days, which is +38 days higher than in 2021 and +7 days higher than in 2020. However, the 2022 figure is still below the pre-pandemic levels. More detailed analysis on these financial indicators will be available in the forthcoming ACE report.

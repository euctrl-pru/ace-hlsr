# FINANCIAL COST-EFFECTIVENESS {#financial}

This section provides a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level.

## PAN-EUROPEAN SYSTEM LEVEL

In 2019, ATM/CNS provision costs (+2.3%) increased faster than composite flight-hours (+1.7%) and as a result unit ATM/CNS provision costs rose by +0.6%.

```{r figure11, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2014-2019 (real terms)", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('Z:/ACE/2019/HLSR in Bookdown/Figure 4-1.png')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figure12) shows the analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into basic economic drivers. These key drivers include:

* ATCO-hour productivity (0.93 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);
* ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€120); and,
* support costs per unit output (€270).

```{r figure12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "ACE performance framework, 2019 (real terms)", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('Z:/ACE/2019/HLSR in Bookdown/Figure 4-2.png')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figure13) below shows that in 2019, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour rose faster (+1.9%) than ATCO-hour productivity (+0.4%). As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour increased (+1.5%). In the meantime, unit support costs remained almost stable (+0.2%) since composite flight-hours (+1.7%) and support costs (+1.8%) rose at a similar pace. As a result, in 2019 unit ATM/CNS provision costs increased by +0.6% at Pan-European system level.

```{r figure13, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2018-2019 (real terms)", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('Z:/ACE/2019/HLSR in Bookdown/Figure 4-3.png')
```
The two following pages provide information on the level of ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs for each individual ANSP.

## ANSP LEVEL

```{r figure14, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Financial gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness^[For the purposes of the ACE benchmarking analysis, costs relating to ATM/CNS infrastructure shared with the military authority (€20.0M) are included in ENAIRE 2019 ATM/CNS provision costs. These costs, which are charged to civil airspace users, are not passing through ENAIRE Accounts from 2014 onwards but are borne by the Spanish Air Force (Ministry of Defence) as well as corresponding revenues. Without these costs, ENAIRE unit ATM/CNS provision costs would be slightly lower and would amount to €371.] , 2019", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

```{r figure17, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Breakdown of support costs per composite flight-hour, 2019", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

```

A more detailed analysis of the changes in cost-effectiveness, ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs will be available in the final ACE 2019 benchmarking report.

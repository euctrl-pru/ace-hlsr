# HIGH-LEVEL REVENUES, COSTS AND STAFF DATA {#high}

This section provides a preliminary presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2019 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2019 amounted to €9 644M. Almost all en-route revenues comes from the collection of en-route charges (95.7%, see left pie chart). The proportion is lower for terminal revenues (69.0%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (21.2% e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).

From a methodological point of view, the ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €8 764M in 2019. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 16%.

```{r figure5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, 2019", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

```

In 2019, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 54% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure \@ref(fig:figure6) below).
Between 2014 and 2019, ATM/CNS provision costs increased continuously (+1.3% per annum, on average) at Pan-European system level (see top chart of Figure \@ref(fig:figure6)). As shown in the bottom right part of Figure \@ref(fig:figure6), the +2.3% increase in ATM/CNS costs observed for the Pan-European system in 2019 masks different trends amongst the 37 ANSPs ^[Sakaeronavigatsia is excluded from the trend analysis provided in the top chart of Figure \@ref(fig:figure6) since no data is available prior to 2015 for this ANSP.]. More details on the changes in ANSPs ATM/CNS provision costs in 2019 will be available in the final ACE 2019 benchmarking report.

```{r figure6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, 2014-2019 (real terms)", out.width='50%', fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

```

The Pan-European ANSPs employed some 56 864 ATM/CNS staff in 2019 (excluding 877 internal MET staff). Some 17 984 staff (32%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (56%) and APP/TWR facilities (44%). On average, 2.2 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.

Between 2014 and 2019, the number of ATM/CNS staff employed by ANSPs increased by +0.2% p.a. (some +668 FTEs).
After two years of consecutive reductions, the total staff number rose by +0.5% (+248 FTEs) in 2017, +1.0% (+554 FTEs) in 2018 and +1.9% (+1 061 FTEs) in 2019. The higher staff number observed for 2019 mainly reflects increases in the following staff categories:

*	Administrative staff (+490 FTEs, or +5.3%);
*	ATCOs in OPS (+220 FTEs, or +1.2%);
*	Technical support for planning and development (+189 FTEs, or +6.2%);
*	Ab-initio trainees (+125 FTEs, or +13.8%);
*	On-the-job trainees (+96 FTEs, or +11.1%).
On the other hand, relatively small decreases are observed for support staff for operational maintenance (-77 FTEs, or -0.8%) and other staff (-63 FTEs, or - 1.6%).

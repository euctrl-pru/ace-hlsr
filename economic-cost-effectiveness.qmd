# Economic cost-effectiveness {#sec-economic}

The concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour. This economic performance indicator is meant to capture trade‐offs between ATC capacity and costs[^economic-cost-effectiveness-1].

[^economic-cost-effectiveness-1]: See https://ansperformance.eu/economics/ace/ace-handbook/ for more information on the methodology used to compute composite flight-hours and economic costs.

@fig-figure-3-1 shows [preliminary results]{.underline} on the changes in economic cost-effectiveness over {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}} - {{< var doc.year_report >}} at Pan-European system level. @fig-figure-3-1-left shows the changes in unit economic costs, while @fig-figure-3-1-right provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays. Unit economic costs significantly reduced in {{< var doc.year_report >}} (-20.7%). This reduction results from the combination of a decrease in ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight-hour (-34.3%) and a large increase in the unit cost of ATFM delays (+324.6%).

In 2022, ATFM delays increased by a factor of almost seven to reach a level of 19.3M minutes. As a result, the share of ATFM delays in the 2022 unit economic costs amounts to 20%. This is close to the level reached in 2019, which was a year marked by significant capacity issues in several ANSPs.

For ten ANSPs the unit cost of ATFM delays represented more than 20% of their unit economic costs. ANSPs generating the highest levels of ATFM delays in 2022 were DFS, DSNA, ENAIRE, NAV Portugal and NATS. For some of these ANSPs, work associated with the implementation of new ATM systems caused a temporary reduction of the available capacity and as a consequence contributed to increase ATFM delays (this was for example the case for DSNA and NAV Portugal). Other ANSPs, such as PANSA, were also affected by military activities due to the war in Ukraine.

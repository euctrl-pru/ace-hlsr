# Economic cost-effectiveness {#sec-economic}

The concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour. This economic performance indicator is meant to capture trade‐offs between ATC capacity and costs[^economic-cost-effectiveness-1].

[^economic-cost-effectiveness-1]: See https://ansperformance.eu/economics/ace/ace-handbook/ for more information on the methodology used to compute composite flight-hours and economic costs.

@fig-figure-3-1 shows [preliminary results]{.underline} on the changes in economic cost-effectiveness between `r year_report-5` and `r year_report` at Pan-European system level. @fig-figure-3-1-left shows the changes in unit economic costs, while @fig-figure-3-1-right provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays.

@fig-figure-3-2 shows [preliminary results]{.underline} at ANSP level (dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles). On average, the share of ATFM delays in `r year_report` was some 4% (compared to 3% in `r year_report-1` and 22% in `r year_report-2`), and only four ANSPs had ATFM delays representing 5% or more of their unit economic costs: HASP (32%), NAV Portugal (8%), DSNA (7%) and LVNL (5%)

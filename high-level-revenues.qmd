This chapter provides a [preliminary]{.underline} presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE {{< var doc.year_report >}} data submissions. Total ANS revenues in {{< var doc.year_report >}} amounted to `r total_reve_f`. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (`r ert_reve_charge_perc`, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (`r trm_reve_charge_perc`, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (`r trm_reve_apt_perc` e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).

Across the Pan-European system, traffic in 2022 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +58.5% higher than in 2021 but remained -12.7% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased slightly less than traffic (+53.6%) and remained -15.4% lower than in 2019.

The ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €8 983M in 2022. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 83% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 17%.

Between {{< var doc.year_report_minus1 >}} and {{< var doc.year_report >}}, total ATM/CNS provision costs rose by +4.2% (+€358.1M), reflecting cost increases from 26 out of 38 ANSPs. Staff costs (+€220.2M), the cost of capital (+163.2M) and non-staff operating costs (+130.5M) were the main sources of increase in 2022.

For staff and non-staff operating costs, this reflects the release of temporary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration, postponement of non-essential activities, etc.). <br><br> The observed trend in the cost of capital is heavily affected by very large increases for DHMI, DFS and LFV. Finally, the cancellation or deferral of non-essential investments resulted in a reduction in depreciation costs (-€82.4M).

In {{< var doc.year_report >}}, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 54% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of @fig-figure-2-3).

The Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 52 843 staff in 2022 (comprising 52 026 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 817 internal MET staff). Some 17 335 staff (33%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (54%) and APP/TWR facilities (46%). On average, 2.0 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.

Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category

<!-- ![Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category](figures/Figure-2-5.png){#fig-figure-2-5 width="75%"} -->

The overall change in staff number observed for {{< var doc.year_report >}} mainly reflects changes in the following staff categories:

-   Administrative staff (-357 FTEs, or -4.1%); and,
-   ATCOs in OPS (+550 FTEs, or +3.3%).

The changes in the number of ATCOs categories may reflect the reallocation of some ATCOs from non-operational duties to OPS, due to the traffic increase after COVID-19 pandemic.

Minor decreases are also observed for OPS support -- non-ATCO (-80 FTEs), ATC assistants (-57 FTEs), technical support staff for planning and development (-38 FTEs), Ab-initio trainees (-30 FTEs).

On the other hand, minor increases are also observed for staff for ancillary services (+41 FTEs) and technical support staff for operational maintenance, monitoring and control (+19 FTEs).

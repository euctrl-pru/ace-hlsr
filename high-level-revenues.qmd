This chapter provides a [preliminary]{.underline} presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE {{< var doc.year_report >}} data submissions. Total ANS revenues in {{< var doc.year_report >}} amounted to `r total_reve_f`. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (`r ert_reve_charge_perc`, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (`r trm_reve_charge_perc`, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (`r trm_reve_apt_perc` e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).

Across the Pan-European system, traffic in 2021 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +27.2% higher than in 2020 but remained -44.9% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased less than traffic (+20.8%) and remained -44.3% lower than in 2019.

The ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €7 937M in 2021. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 16%.

Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, {{< var doc.year_report >}}
:::

In {{< var doc.year_report >}}, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 56% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of @fig-figure-2-3).

Between {{< var doc.year_report_minus1 >}} and {{< var doc.year_report >}}, total ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -4.9% (-€408.4M), reflecting cost reductions from 27 out of 38 ANSPs. When considering the savings already achieved in 2020, the cumulative decrease since 2019 is -8.8% (-€765M).

Staff costs were by far the main source of savings in {{< var doc.year_report >}} (-€221.4M). This reflects both the effect of temporary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration...) but also the effect of redundancy plans. <br><br> A majority of ANSPs also maintained lower level of non-staff operating costs or reduced it further in 2021 leading to a decrease of -€102.4M. Similarly, the cancellation or deferral of non-essential investments resulted in further reduction in depreciation costs (-€42.3M). Exceptional costs decreased by -€94.4M in 2021 mainly reflecting the fact that this cost item was particularly high in 2020 due to the reporting of redundancy costs.<br><br>The only cost item increasing in 2021 was the cost of capital (+€52.2M), mainly due to large increases for DHMI and NATS, reflecting increases in their asset base and weighted average cost of capital.

![Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}}-{{< var doc.year_report >}} (real terms)](figures/Figure-2-3.png){width="75%"}

The Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 53 014 staff in 2021 (comprising 52 164 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 850 internal MET staff). Some 16 781 staff (32%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%). On average, 3.1 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.

Breakdown of total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level, {{< var doc.year_report >}}
:::

In {{< var doc.year_report >}}, the number of ATM/CNS staff fell by -1.5% (-796 FTEs) compared to 2020.

![Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category](figures/Figure-2-5.png){#fig-figure-2-5 width="75%"}

The lower staff number observed for {{< var doc.year_report >}} mainly reflects decreases in the following staff categories:

-   Administrative staff (-338 FTEs, or -3.7%);
-   ATCOs in OPS (-201 FTEs, or 1.2%);
-   Ab-initio trainees (-126 FTEs, or 12.5%); and,
-   Technical support staff for operational maintenance, monitoring and control (-102 FTEs, or -1.2%).

On the other hand, increase is observed for ATCOs on other duties (+154 FTEs) reflecting a reallocation of some ATCOs from operational to non-operational duties due to the relatively low traffic levels in 2021 compared to pre-crisis. Minor increases are also observed for staff for ancillary services (+14 FTEs) and other staff (+25 FTEs).

In addition to the measures on staff costs already mentioned above (redundancies, short-time work / furlough schemes), it is important to note that during the lockdown periods, some ANSPs staff had to consume accumulated holidays not used in previous years and/or made use of pre-retirement schemes.

The scope is therefore wider than gate-to-gate ATM/CNS which is used to calculate the other ACE key performance indicators, but depending on what ANSPs include under \"Other ANS\", it might not necessarily match with the whole activities of the ANSP.\n\n![Changes in ANSPs balance sheet structure (2019-{{< var doc.year_report >}})](figures/Figure-5-bal-str.png){#fig-figure-5-1 width=\"75%\"}\n\n\n@fig-figure-toto shows capital and reserves increased by +4.2% in {{< var doc.year_report >}} but remained - €778M lower than in 2019.\nIn the meantime, short and long term borrowings continued to increase (+33.5% in {{< var doc.year_report >}}), reaching €5 900M, which is three times higher than in 2019.\n\n::: {#fig-figure-toto layout-ncol=2 width=\"50%\"}\n\n![](figures/Figure-5-cap-res.png)\n\n![](figures/Figure-5-borrow.png)\n\nChanges in ANSPs capital and reserves and borrowing, 2019-{{< var doc.year_report >}} (real terms)\n:::\nIn order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on the ANS industry, the PRC uses indicators aiming at monitoring ANSPs financial situation. For more details on how these indicators have been defined for the purposes of this analysis, along with their limitations, please refer to Section 4.2 of the ACE 2020 report.\n\n@fig-figure-5-cash shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2016-2021 period as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. Cash-on-hand days measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\n\n![2016-{{< var doc.year_report >}} trends in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level](figures/Figure-5-cash.png){#fig-figure-5-cash width=\"50%\"}\n\nIn 2021, the average cash-on-hand days amounted to 105 days, which is -32 days (or -23%) lower than in 2020 and -62 days (or -37%) lower than over the 2016-2019 period.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The ACE benchmarking work is commissioned by the Performance Review Commission (PRC) and carried out by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) using information provided by Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in compliance with Decision No. 88 of the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL on economic information disclosure1.\nThe data processing, analysis and reporting are conducted with the assistance of the ACE Working Group, which comprises representatives from participating ANSPs, airspace users, regulatory authorities and the Performance Review Unit. This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and data limitations.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2024 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the final ACE benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2026. This document also presents financial indicators extracted from the ANSPs Financial Indicators Dashboard and monitoring ANSPs’ cash holdings and liquidity.\nEconomic information disclosure by ANSPs takes time as it depends on the publication of their financial statements, which can be a lengthy process. Indeed, after the finalisation of their financial accounts, ANSPs have to follow official procedures which include, inter alia, the preparation of an independent audit report and the formal approval for publication which is granted by the relevant authorities (sometimes at Ministry level). This explains the lag between the review of the 2024 operational performance presented in the Performance Review Report (published in March 2025) and the publication of this document in December 2025. It should be noted that operational conditions continued to evolve in 2025, and ATFM delay performance has improved for several of ANSPs.\nThe final ACE benchmarking report will provide more detailed information on observed changes for selected performance indicators both at Pan-European system level and at ANSP level. This detailed analysis will particularly focus on ANSPs for which significant differences in costs are observed. The report will present the main drivers underlying these differences.\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the timeline to produce the next ACE benchmarking report.\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible.\nTwenty out of 38 ANSPs submitted their ACE 2024 data on time by the 1st of July 2025 and all data submissions were received by the end of September 2025. The timescale to produce the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. Indeed, the data submission milestone is just the first step of a process which comprises a thorough verification and analysis of individual ANSP submissions. This validation exercise also includes a formal round of exchange between the PRU and each ANSP in order to ensure a common understanding of the data submitted by the ANSP.\nThe data used in this document reflects the information received by the 12th of November 2025. Figure 1.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE benchmarking report in May 2026.\nThe remainder of this report is structured as follows:",

    "text": "2.1 Revenues and traffic\nThis chapter provides a preliminary overview of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2024 data submissions.\nTotal ANS revenues in 2024 amounted to €12 002M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (95.8%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (73.7%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (17.5%) through, for example, a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator.\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2024 (measured in composite flight-hours) increased by +5.5% compared to 2023 and exceeded the 2019 level by +1.6%. Meanwhile, total gate-to-gate revenues grew faster than traffic, rising by +7.4% (or +€829M) and surpassing 2019 revenues by +3.7%. As detailed in the following sections of this report, the increase in revenues in 2024 outpaced the rise in ATM/CNS costs and coincided with ongoing increases in capital and reserves as well as reductions in borrowings at the Pan-European system level.\nAt ANSP level, traffic in 2024 showed varied patterns of recovery, influenced both by the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the ongoing war in Ukraine, which led to significant changes in route structures and traffic volumes due to airspace closures and reciprocal sanctions on air carriers (see Figure 2.3). On the recovery side, some ANSPs such as Sakaeronavigatsia and Albcontrol recorded substantial increases in composite flight-hours, reaching +116% and +68% above 2019 levels respectively. In contrast, others like LGS and EANS remained below pre-pandemic levels, at -32% and - 23%, respectively. This inevitably impacted the levels and trends of ACE indicators for the most affected ANSPs.",

Some 17 584 staff (33%) were ATCOs working on operational duties, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%).

    "text": "Gate-to-gate ATFM delays in 2024 reached 29.6 million minutes, resulting in an estimated cost of €3.9 billion on airspace users, the highest level ever recorded. This figure represents more than one-third of ATM/CNS provision costs at the Pan-European system level and surpasses total ATCO in OPS employment costs.\nThe concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour. This economic performance indicator is meant to capture trade‐offs between quality of service provided and costs1.\nFigure 3.1 shows preliminary results on the changes in economic cost-effectiveness over 2019 - 2024 at Pan-European system level. The left-hand side shows the changes in unit economic costs, while the chart on the right-hand side provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays. Unit economic costs rose by +2.4% in 2024, driven by a +14.4% increase in the unit costs of ATFM delays, which outweighed a -1.4% reduction in ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight-hour. As a result, unit economic costs were +4.7% above 2019 levels.\nIn 2024, ATFM delays increased by +20.7% to some 29.6M minutes, raising the share of ATFM delays in unit economic costs to 26.9% (from 24.1% in 2023). This is the highest share ever recorded. Considering the total estimated costs of ATFM delays in 2024 (€3.9 billion), it represents more than one-third of ATM/CNS provision costs at the Pan-European system level and surpasses total ATCO in OPS employment costs.\nFigure 3.2 shows preliminary results at ANSP level (dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles, €433 and €704, respectively).\nFor 15 ANSPs ATFM delays represented more than 20% of their unit economic costs (see ANSPs with the largest red and yellow portions, e.g. HungaroControl, Croatia Control, HASP, M-NAV, BHANSA, etc.). In absolute terms (cumulative ATFM delays in minutes) DSNA, DFS, ENAIRE, HungaroControl and NATS were the five ANSPs generating the highest levels of ATFM delays in 2024 (61.8% of the Pan-European system total ATFM delays).\nThe primary sources of ATFM delays in 2024 were capacity and staffing shortages, followed by adverse weather conditions. The situation at HungaroControl was particularly exceptional, as a combination of factors led to unusually high levels of ATFM delays. According to the Network Manager’s Operations Report, several issues impacted HungaroControl performance in 2024, most notably unforeseen staffing challenges and a significant surge in traffic demand (an increase of +6% compared to 2023 and +15% compared to 2019), partly driven by the situation in Ukraine. Adverse weather further compounded these difficulties. It is noteworthy that the situation has improved significantly in 2025.\nFurther analysis of the relationship between changes in ANSPs costs, traffic and unit costs will be analysed in detail in the forthcoming ACE report.",

    "text": "4.1 Pan-European system level\nThis chapter provides a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness.\nFigure 4.1 shows that ATM/CNS costs per composite flight-hour stood at €469 in 2024, which is slightly lower than pre-COVID-19 level and represents the lowest level since the inception of ACE benchmarking activities in 2002. Compared to 2023, unit ATM/CNS provision costs were -1.4% lower, as traffic (+5.5%) rose faster than ATM/CNS provision costs (+4.0%).\nThe analytical framework used in the ACE analysis to break down the ATM/CNS provision cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.98 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€152); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€314).\nFigure 4.3 shows that in 2024, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour rose by +3.9% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +4.8% compared to 2023. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased by -0.9%. In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -1.6% due to an increase in composite flight-hours (+5.5%) being partly offset by an increase in support costs (+3.8%). Consequently, in 2024, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -1.4% at the Pan-European system level compared to 2023, taking into account the relative weighting of ATCO employment and support costs based on their shares of total ATM/CNS provision costs.\nAs the values of the 2023 indicators were still affected by the persistent consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, Figure 4.4 below provides an additional analysis using 2019 as a reference year. It shows that in 2024 traffic was +1.6% above its 2019 level. Support costs decreased slightly (-0.8%), but because composite flight-hours increased, support costs per composite flight-hour fell more significantly (-2.4%). ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour were +2.1% higher than in 2019, driven by an increase in employment costs per ATCO-hour (+2.3%) while ATCO-hour productivity improved marginally (+0.3%). As a result, ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight-hour were -0.9% lower than in 2019.",

Because of their weight in the Pan-European system, the six largest ANSPs by cost (DFS, DHMI, DSNA, ENAIRE, ENAV and NATS) are also shown in a miniature replica of the chart (top right corner of the figures). The 1st and 3rd quartiles for each indicator are also shown in all figures. The gap between these two quartiles provides additional insight on the dispersion of the values.\nMany factors contribute to observed differences in ANSPs’ performance. Over the years, the Performance Review Unit has identified factors which can be of an exogenous nature (i.e. those outside the control of an ANSP) or of an endogenous nature (those entirely under the ANSP’s control). A detailed list of these factors can be found in the ACE Handbook.\nFigure 4.5 presents the ATM/CNS provision gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness indicator at ANSP level for the year 2024.

UkSATSE, excluded from the ACE analysis due to the war in Ukraine and the absence of traffic, is nevertheless included in the dashboard and in this chapter, since it continued publishing financial statements.\nDepending on the organisational set-up of different ANSPs, the information reported in their financial statements covers a varying scope of activities (e.g. it may include airport management operations, commercial activities, etc.), which does not always correspond to the ACE gate-to-gate scope.\nFigure 5.1 presents the evolution of the current ratio at Pan-European system level1 between 2019 and 2024 as well as the 1st and 3rd quartiles. The current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term debt obligations with its current assets.\nFigure 5.1 shows that the average current ratio for ANSPs declined from 2.73 in 2019 to a low point of 1.89 in 2021, due to pandemic-related revenue drops, but subsequently improved through 2022 and 2023, reaching 3.21 before reducing slightly to 3.03 in 2024. This overall recovery indicates a strengthening of sector-wide liquidity compared to the trough of the crisis, although financial resilience continues to vary considerably across ANSPs. The 3rd quartile continued to rise and reached 4.68 in 2024, exceeding its pre-crisis level. By contrast, the 1st quartile—after a modest recovery from its 2021 low—remained weak and declined slightly in 2024 to 1.66, confirming that liquidity at the lower end of the sector has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nFigure 5.2 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2019 - 2024 period as well as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. The cash-on-hand days indicator (cash & cash equivalents divided by operating costs x 365) measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\nFigure 5.2 shows that cash-on-hand days fell sharply from 157 in 2019 to 85 in 2021, reflecting the impact of the pandemic, before improving to 116 days in 2022. However, this recovery was not sustained, as the average decreased to 102 days in 2023, then edged up slightly to 107 days in 2024. Overall, liquidity remains below pre-pandemic levels. Dispersion across ANSPs persists: the 3rd quartile rose to 211 days in 2024, still below its 2019 peak of 255 days, while the 1st quartile recovered to 67 days, slightly above its pre-pandemic level of 54 days.\nMore detailed analysis on these financial indicators will be available in the forthcoming ACE report.",

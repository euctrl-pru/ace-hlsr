    "text": "This chapter provides a preliminary overview of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2022 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2022 amounted to €9 024M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (95.9%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (68.3%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (21.3%) through, for example, a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn-route\n      %\n      Gate-togate revenues (€ M)\n       %\n      Terminal\n    \n\n\n6 928\n95.9%\nIncome from charges\n68.3%\n1 229\n\n\nn.a.\nn.a.\nIncome from airport operators\n21.3%\n  383\n\n\n    1.0\n0.01%\nIncome from the military\n0.04%\n    0.7\n\n\n   63\n0.9%\nIncome in respect of exempted flights\n2.9%\n   51\n\n\n   62\n0.9%\nIncome from domestic goverment\n4.1%\n   75\n\n\n  122\n1.7%\nFinancial income\n2.1%\n   38\n\n\n   49\n0.7%\nOther income (incl. exceptional revenue item)\n1.2%\n   22\n\n\n7 224\n100%\n\n100%\n1 800\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Breakdown of gate-to-gate ANS revenues, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2022 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +58.3% higher than in 2021 but remained -13.3% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased slightly less than traffic (+55.3%) and remained -14.9% lower than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt ANSP level, a wide range of recovery rates is observed, ranging from -51% to +14% (see Figure 2.2). The war in Ukraine also resulted in airspace closures and reciprocal sanctions on air carriers which impacted traffic flows in Europe. This inevitably impacts the levels and trends of ACE indicators for the ANSPs being most affected by the changes in traffic patterns.\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Changes in composite flight-hours between 2019 and 2022\n\nThe ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €8 921M in 2022. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented around 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n      \n        En-route\n      \n      \n        Terminal\n      \n      \n        Gate-to-gate\n      \n    \n\n€ M\n      %\n       € M\n       %\n        € M\n        %\n    \n\n\n\nStaff costs\n4 550\n 65.2%\n1 275\n 65.4%\n5 825\n 65.3%\n\n\nATCOs in OPS employment costs\n2 229\nn.a.\n  631\nn.a.\n2 859\nn.a.\n\n\nOther staff employment costs    \n2 321\nn.a.\n  644\nn.a.\n2 965\nn.a.\n\n\nNon-staff operating costs\n1 155\n 16.6%\n  332\n 17.0%\n1 487\n 16.7%\n\n\nDepreciation costs\n  702\n 10.1%\n  172\n  8.9%\n  875\n  9.8%\n\n\nCost of capital\n  453\n  6.5%\n  129\n  6.6%\n  582\n  6.5%\n\n\nExceptional items\n  113\n  1.6%\n   40\n  2.0%\n  152\n  1.7%\n\n\nTotal ATM/CNS provision costs\n6 973\n100.0%\n1 948\n100.0%\n8 921\n100.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years of consecutive decreases, total ATM/CNS provision costs rose by +3.4% (+€296.8M) in 2022, reflecting cost increases for 26 out of 38 ANSPs. Non-staff operating costs (+€118.8M) and the cost of capital (+€115.7M) were the main sources of increase in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor non-staff operating costs, this mainly reflects the fact that 2021 ANSPs cost-bases were affected by the temporary measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration, postponement of non-essential activities, etc.).  The observed trend in the cost of capital is heavily affected by very large increases for DHMI, DFS and LFV.\n\n\nIn 2022, the five largest ANSPs (DFS, DSNA, ENAIRE, ENAV and NATS) bore some 53% of the total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure 2.3).\n\nTrends in ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs (real terms)\n\n\n\nThe Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 52 497 staff in 2022 (comprising 51 680 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 817 internal MET staff). Some 17 142 staff (33%) were ATCOs working on operational duties, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%). On average, 2.0 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Breakdown of total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\nIn 2022, the number of ATM/CNS staff was slightly lower than in 2021 (-0.9% or -473 FTEs).\n\nTrends in gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category\n\n\n\nThe overall change in staff numbers observed for 2022 mainly reflects changes in the following staff categories:\n\nAdministrative staff (-357 FTEs, or -4.1%);\nATCOs in OPS (+356 FTEs, or +2.1%); and,\nATCOs on other duties (-215 FTEs or -8.7%).\n\nTo some extent, the changes observed for the ATCOs categories may reflect the fact that some ATCOs previously reported as “on other duties” following the traffic decrease in 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are now re-allocated to OPS duties.\nDecreases are also observed for technical support staff for operational maintenance (-1.7%), OPS support staff (-2.0%), ab-initio trainees (-7.6%), ATC assistants (-3.1%), technical support staff for planning and development (-1.2%) an other staff (-0.2%). Conversely, the number of on-the job trainees (+8.9%) and staff for ancillary services (+2.2%) rose in 2022."

    "text": "4.1 Pan-European system level\nFigure 4.1 shows that in 2022 the unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -34.7% compared to 2021, reaching an amount of €470. This is the result of traffic increase (+58.3%) coupled with the growth of ATM/CNS provision costs (+3.4%).\nHowever, Comparing with pre-pandemic levels, in 2022 unit ATM/CNS provision costs still remain +8.2% higher than in 2019. This mainly reflects the fact that, despite a lower cost-base (-6.1% compared to 2019) traffic volumes in 2022 still did not reach the 2019 level (-13.3%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2017 – 2022 (real terms)\n\nThe analytical framework used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.88 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€133); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€319).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: ACE performance framework, 2022 (real terms)\n\nFigure 4.3 shows that in 2022, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour fell by -2.3% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +46.9%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-33.5%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -35.2% due to the combination of an increase in composite flight-hours (+58.3%) and an increase in support costs (+2.6%). As a result, in 2022, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -34.7% at Pan-European system level.\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2021 – 2022 (real terms)\n\nAs the values of the 2021 indicators were significantly affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, Figure 4.4 below provides an additional analysis using 2019 as a reference year. It shows that in 2022 the traffic was still well below its 2019 level and, despite a reduction in total support costs, the unit support costs were higher than in 2019. A similar situation is observed on the ATCO employment costs side where the reduction in employment costs per ATCO-hour was not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in ATCO-hour productivity. Overall, the unit cost in 2022 was then +8.7% higher than in 2019.\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2019 – 2022 (real terms)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter provides an overview of ANSPs’ financial situation over the 2017 - 2022 period, using two indicators: the current ratio and the cash-on-hand days. These indicators have been calculated at pan-European system level using the information provided in the ANSPs’ Financial Statements which were available at the time of publishing this report (34 for the 2017-2021 period and 22 in 2022). The indicators are therefore consistent with those published at individual ANSP level in the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Unit ANSPs Financial Dashboard.\nDepending on the organisational set up of different ANSPs, the information reported in their financial statements covers a different scope of activities (e.g. it may include airport management operations, commercial activities, etc.) which does not always correspond with the ACE gate-to-gate scope. Additionally, due to specific organisational and financial set up, DCAC Cyprus, HASP, LVNL and MUAC, are excluded from the analysis presented in this chapter.\nFigure 5.1 presents the changes in the average current ratio between 2017 and 2022 as well as the 1st and 3rd quartiles. The current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term debt obligations with its current assets. On average, the situation slightly improved in 2022 following four years of continuous deterioration. However, for 25% of the sample, the current ratio has shown almost no improvement since reaching its lowest level in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Trends in ANSPs current ratio 2017 - 2022\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2017 - 2022 period as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. The cash-on-hand days indicator (cash & cash equivalents divided by operating costs x 365) measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: 2017 - 2022 trends in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level\n\n\nIn 2022, the average cash-on-hand days amounted to 177 days, which is +70 days higher than in 2021 and +7 days higher than in 2020. The 2022 figure reached the pre-pandemic levels. More detailed analysis on these financial indicators will be available in the forthcoming ACE report."

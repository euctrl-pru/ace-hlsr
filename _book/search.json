    "text": "Cash flow indicators calculated from ANSPs financial statements\nFree cash flow is an indicator widely used by other aviation industry stakeholders. Here it is presented at an organisational level, based on the information reported in ANSPs’ financial statements. Depending on the organisational set up of ANSPs, this information may cover a wider scope of activities than the scope reported in the ACE submissions for “Total ANS”. In the case of DFS, the financial reporting standards used to establish route charges and for ACE reporting (regulatory accounting) are also different from the reporting standards used in DFS financial statements (IFRS).\nThe free cash flow to revenues ratio provides a representation of the cash generated by operations (after accounting for capital investments) which is available to repay creditors or pay dividends and interests to investors. It can therefore be broken down in two elements: a) the net cash from operating activities and b) the capital expenditures (CAPEX). Dividing these ratios by revenues allows an easier interpretation of the indicators when looking at organisations of different size.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: 2019-2020 trends in free cash flow to revenues ratio at ANSP level\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows the 2019-2020 changes in free cash flow to revenues ratio (and its components) at ANSP level for 24 ANSPs for which data is publically available at the time of writing this report4.\nWhereas 15 of these ANSPs had a positive ratio in 2019, all ANSPs analysed (with the exception of Albcontrol) have a negative ratio in 2020. Although changes in the free cash flow are mainly driven by changes in the net cash flow from operating activities (see middle chart in Figure 1.2), it is interesting to note that when the free cash flow was negative in 2019, it was in several cases due to relatively large capital expenditures during the year (e.g. in 2019, Sakaeronavigatsia and LGS respectively invested 37% and 29% of their revenues).\nMore detailed analysis of changes in the free cash flow to revenues ratio will be provided in the ACE 2020 benchmarking report.\n\n\nThe analysis of ANSPs indicators shows that the situation deteriorated on several criteria:\n\nThe ability to cover short-term debt by using current assets was reduced by almost one third compared to the 2015-2019 period (current ratio falling from 3.6 to 2.6).\nCash reserves at the end of 2020 were sufficient to cover 136 days of operating expenses (34 days less than over the 2015-2019 period). When interpreting this indicator, it is important to consider the fact that loans contracted but not fully used in 2020 appear as cash in the balance sheet.\nThe equity ratio was around 0.4 at the end of 2020, which is lower than the 0.5 measured over the 2015-2019 period. This reduction results from the combination of a) lower capital reserves due to losses incurred in 2020 and b) the increase in borrowings.\n\nBased on a sample of 24 ANSPs, the net cash flow from operating activities in 2020 became negative (-€1.5 billion compared to €2.0 billion in 2020). When also considering the cash outflow for capital expenditures, the free cash flow amounted to -€2.2 billion in 2020.\n\n\n\n{r Figure-5-7, out.width='100%',echo=FALSE} knitr::include_graphics('figures/Figure-5-7.png')"

This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and limitations of the data.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2020 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the ACE 2020 benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2022. It also presents specific financial indicators that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure Figure 5.1 illustrates the timeline for the production of the ACE 2020 benchmarking report.\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. These data reflect the information stored in the ACE database on the 11th November 2021. Figure Figure 5.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE 2020 benchmarking report in May 2022.\nFigure Figure 5.3) below shows that 20 ANSPs provided their ACE 2020 data submission on time by the 1st July 2021 and that, in total, 26 data submissions were received by the 15th July 2021. Figure Figure 5.3 also indicates that for 11 ANSPs the ACE data submission was received more than one month after the deadline.\nClearly, the timescale for the production of the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nThe remainder of this report is organised as follows:"

    "text": "This section provides a preliminary presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2020 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2020 amounted to €4 502M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (91.4%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (50.9%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (31.2% e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).\nThe ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €8 228M in 2020. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 16%.\nIn 2020, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 56% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure 4.3).\nATM/CNS provision costs increased by +1.3% p.a. between 2015 and 2019, and then fell by -5.0% in 2020 as ANSPs implemented a range of measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidities. As shown in the bottom right part of Figure 4.3, the -5.0% decrease in ATM/CNS costs in 2020 reflects reductions for 31 out of 38 ANSPs. More details on the changes in ANSPs ATM/CNS provision costs in 2020 will be available in the final ACE 2020 benchmarking report.\nThe Pan-European employed a total of 55 712 staff in 2020 (comprising 54 871 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 845 internal MET staff). Some 17 400 staff (32%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (56%) and APP/TWR facilities (44%). On average, 2.2 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.\nAfter four years of continuous increase in the number of ATM/CNS staff (+0.6% p.a. between 2015 and 2019, or +1 384 FTEs), 2020 showed a -3.4% reduction (-1 936 FTEs).\nThe lower staff number observed for 2020 mainly reflects decreases in the following staff categories:\nOn the other hand, increases are observed for ATCOs on other duties (+121 FTEs) and on-the-job trainees (+141 FTEs), reflecting a reallocation of some ATCOs from operational to non-operational duties due to the traffic reduction in 2020, and the fact that newly recruited ATCOs had to complete their on-the-job training."

    "text": "3.3 Cash flow indicators calculated from ANSPs financial statements\nFree cash flow is an indicator widely used by other aviation industry stakeholders. Here it is presented at an organisational level, based on the information reported in ANSPs’ financial statements. Depending on the organisational set up of ANSPs, this information may cover a wider scope of activities than the scope reported in the ACE submissions for “Total ANS”. In the case of DFS, the financial reporting standards used to establish route charges and for ACE reporting (regulatory accounting) are also different from the reporting standards used in DFS financial statements (IFRS).\nThe free cash flow to revenues ratio provides a representation of the cash generated by operations (after accounting for capital investments) which is available to repay creditors or pay dividends and interests to investors. It can therefore be broken down in two elements: a) the net cash from operating activities and b) the capital expenditures (CAPEX). Dividing these ratios by revenues allows an easier interpretation of the indicators when looking at organisations of different size.\n\n\nFigure 3.2: 2019-2020 trends in free cash flow to revenues ratio at ANSP level\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows the 2019-2020 changes in free cash flow to revenues ratio (and its components) at ANSP level for 24 ANSPs for which data is publically available at the time of writing this report4.\nWhereas 15 of these ANSPs had a positive ratio in 2019, all ANSPs analysed (with the exception of Albcontrol) have a negative ratio in 2020. Although changes in the free cash flow are mainly driven by changes in the net cash flow from operating activities (see middle chart in Figure 1.2), it is interesting to note that when the free cash flow was negative in 2019, it was in several cases due to relatively large capital expenditures during the year (e.g. in 2019, Sakaeronavigatsia and LGS respectively invested 37% and 29% of their revenues).\nMore detailed analysis of changes in the free cash flow to revenues ratio will be provided in the ACE 2020 benchmarking report.\n\n\nThe analysis of ANSPs indicators shows that the situation deteriorated on several criteria:\n\nThe ability to cover short-term debt by using current assets was reduced by almost one third compared to the 2015-2019 period (current ratio falling from 3.6 to 2.6).\nCash reserves at the end of 2020 were sufficient to cover 136 days of operating expenses (34 days less than over the 2015-2019 period). When interpreting this indicator, it is important to consider the fact that loans contracted but not fully used in 2020 appear as cash in the balance sheet.\nThe equity ratio was around 0.4 at the end of 2020, which is lower than the 0.5 measured over the 2015-2019 period. This reduction results from the combination of a) lower capital reserves due to losses incurred in 2020 and b) the increase in borrowings.\n\nBased on a sample of 24 ANSPs, the net cash flow from operating activities in 2020 became negative (-€1.5 billion compared to €2.0 billion in 2020). When also considering the cash outflow for capital expenditures, the free cash flow amounted to -€2.2 billion in 2020.\n\n\n\n{r Figure-5-7, out.width='100%',echo=FALSE} knitr::include_graphics('figures/Figure-5-7.png')"

On average, the share of ATFM delays in 2020 was 3% (compared to 22% in 2019), and only five ANSPs had ATFM delays representing more than 5% of their unit economic costs (compared to 22 ANSPs in 2019)."

This extraordinary increase is mainly due to the decrease in composite flight-hours (-56.8%) while ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -5.0%.\nThe analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into basic economic drivers is presented in Figure Figure 3.2. These key drivers include:\n\nATCO-hour productivity (0.48 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€133); and,\nSupport costs per unit output (€589).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2015-2020 (real terms)\n\n\nFigure 3.2 shows that in 2020, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour rose by +12.2% while ATCO-hour productivity fell by -49.0%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour increased (+120.1%).\nIn the meantime, unit support costs rose by +120.0% since the fall in composite flight-hours (-56.8%) was much greater than the reduction in support costs (-5.0%). As a result, in 2020 unit ATM/CNS provision costs increased by +120.0% at Pan-European system level.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: ACE performance framework, 2020 (real terms)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2019-2020 (real terms)"

In all these figures, the dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles.\nThere are three main elements to be considered when interpreting the level of the indicators as well as ANSPs rankings in the figures below: a) the traffic reduction in 2020, although being massive for all ANSPs, was not completely homogeneous, b) there were different responses in cost adjustments, and c) there were also different levels of flexibility in adjusting the workforce, and in particular ATCO in OPS hours on duty, which has an enormous impact on the ATCO productivity and employment costs indicators measured in the ACE report.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Financial gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: ATCO-hour productivity, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Employment costs per ATCO-hour, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Breakdown of support costs per composite flight-hour, 2020\n\n\nA more detailed analysis of the changes in cost-effectiveness, ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs will be available in the final ACE 2020 benchmarking report."

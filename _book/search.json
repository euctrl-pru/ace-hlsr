    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter provides a preliminary presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2022 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2022 amounted to €8 929M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (95.9%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (69.0%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (21.6% e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Breakdown of gate-to-gate ANS revenues, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2021 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +27.2% higher than in 2020 but remained -44.9% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased less than traffic (+20.8%) and remained -44.3% lower than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €7 937M in 2021. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, total ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -4.9% (-€408.9M), reflecting cost reductions from 27 out of 38 ANSPs. When considering the savings already achieved in 2020, the cumulative decrease since 2019 is -8.8% (-€765M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff costs were by far the main source of savings in 2022 (-€221.7M). This reflects both the effect of temporary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration…) but also the effect of redundancy plans.  A majority of ANSPs also maintained lower level of non-staff operating costs or reduced it further in 2021 leading to a decrease of -€102.5M. Similarly, the cancellation or deferral of non-essential investments resulted in further reduction in depreciation costs (-€42.4M). Exceptional costs decreased by -€94.4M in 2021 mainly reflecting the fact that this cost item was particularly high in 2020 due to the reporting of redundancy costs.The only cost item increasing in 2021 was the cost of capital (+€52.2M), mainly due to large increases for DHMI and NATS, reflecting increases in their asset base and weighted average cost of capital.\n\nIn 2022, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 56% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure 2.3).\n\nTrends in ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs (real terms)\n\n\n\nThe Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 53 014 staff in 2021 (comprising 52 164 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 850 internal MET staff). Some 16 781 staff (32%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%). On average, 2.1 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Breakdown of total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\n\nIn 2022, the number of ATM/CNS staff fell by -1.5% (-796 FTEs) compared to 2020.\n\nTrends in gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category\n\n\n\nThe lower staff number observed for 2022 mainly reflects decreases in the following staff categories:\n\nAdministrative staff (-338 FTEs, or -3.7%);\nATCOs in OPS (-201 FTEs, or -1.2%);\nAb-initio trainees (-126 FTEs, or -12.5%); and,\nTechnical support staff for operational maintenance, monitoring and control (-102 FTEs, or -1.2%).\n\nOn the other hand, increase is observed for ATCOs on other duties (+154 FTEs) reflecting a reallocation of some ATCOs from operational to non-operational duties due to the relatively low traffic levels in 2021 compared to pre-crisis. Minor increases are also observed for staff for ancillary services (+14 FTEs) and other staff (+25 FTEs).\n\nIn addition to the measures on staff costs already mentioned above (redundancies, short-time work / furlough schemes), it is important to note that during the lockdown periods, some ANSPs staff had to consume accumulated holidays not used in previous years and/or made use of pre-retirement schemes."

This mainly reflects the fact that, despite a reduced cost-base (-8.8% compared to 2020) traffic volumes in 2022 were still significantly lower than in 2020 (-44.9%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2017 – 2022 (real terms)\n\n\nThe analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.60 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€125); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€454).\n\n\nFigure 4.2: ACE performance framework, 2022 (real terms)\n\n\nFigure 4.3 shows that in 2022, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour fell by -8.5% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +24.8%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-26.7%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -24.5% due to the combination of an increase in composite flight-hours (+27.2%) and a reduction in support costs (-4.0%). As a result, in 2021, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -25.2% at Pan-European system level.\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2021 – 2022 (real terms)"

    "text": "This chapter provides a preliminary analysis of specific indicators that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and 2022. Due to specific organisational and financial set up in HASP, LVNL and MUAC, these three ANSPs are excluded from the analysis presented in this chapter.\nFigure 5.1 presents the changes in ANSPs balance sheet structure as reported in their ACE data submissions at “Total ANS” level (i.e. en-route, terminal and other ANS). The scope is therefore wider than gate-to-gate ATM/CNS which is used to calculate the other ACE key performance indicators, but depending on what ANSPs include under “Other ANS”, it might not necessarily match with the whole activities of the ANSP.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Changes in ANSPs balance sheet structure (2019-2022)\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows capital and reserves increased by +4.2% in 2022 but remained -€778M lower than in 2019. In the meantime, short and long term borrowings continued to increase (+33.5% in 2022), reaching €5 900M, which is three times higher than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Changes in ANSPs capital and reserves and borrowing, 2019-2022 (real terms)\n\n\nIn order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on the ANS industry, the PRC uses indicators aiming at monitoring ANSPs financial situation. For more details on how these indicators have been defined for the purposes of this analysis, along with their limitations, please refer to Section 4.2 of the ACE 2020 report.\nFigure 5.3 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2016-2021 period as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. Cash-on-hand days measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: 2016-2022 trends in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level\n\n\nIn 2021, the average cash-on-hand days amounted to 105 days, which is -32 days (or -23%) lower than in 2020 and -62 days (or -37%) lower than over the 2016-2019 period."

    "text": "The concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour. This economic performance indicator is meant to capture trade‐offs between ATC capacity and costs1.\nFigure 3.1 shows preliminary results on the changes in economic cost-effectiveness over 2017 - 2022 at Pan-European system level. Figure 3.1 (a) shows the changes in unit economic costs, while Figure 3.1 (b) provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays.

    "text": "The ACE benchmarking work is commissioned by the Performance Review Commission (PRC) and carried out by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) using information provided by Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in compliance with Decision No. 88 of the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL on economic information disclosure1.\nThe data processing, analysis and reporting are conducted with the assistance of the ACE Working Group, which comprises representatives from participating ANSPs, airspace users, regulatory authorities and the Performance Review Unit. This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and limitations of the data.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2022 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the next ACE benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2024. It also presents specific financial indicators, extracted from the ANSPs Financial Indicators Dashboard, that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. [Add intro to new theme of the year if we can].\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the timeline for the production of the next ACE benchmarking report.\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Timeline for the production of the next ACE benchmarking report\n\n\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible.\nSeventeen ANSPs provided their ACE 2022 data submission on time by the 1st of July 2023 and, all data submissions were received by the end of August 2023. This constitutes a major improvement compared to previous years. Clearly, the timescale for the production of the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. These data reflect the information stored in the ACE database on the 7th of November 2023. Figure 1.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✔️Data submission has been reviewed\n\nFigure 1.2: Status of 2022 data validation process\n\n\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE 2022 benchmarking report in May 2024.\nThe remainder of this report is organised as follows:\n\n\nChapter 2: provides a high-level presentation of 2022 revenues, costs and staff data.\n\nChapter 3: presents a preliminary analysis of economic cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\nChapter 4: presents a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level, and underlying components.\n\nChapter 5: presents a preliminary analysis of specific financial indicators at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\nChapter 6: presents a preliminary overview of TBC…\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the war in Ukraine, UkSATSE was not able to provide ACE 2022 data. UkSATSE is therefore excluded from the ACE analysis.↩︎"

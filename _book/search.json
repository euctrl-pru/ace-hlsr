    "text": "The ACE benchmarking work is commissioned by the Performance Review Commission (PRC) and carried out by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) using information provided by Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in compliance with Decision No. 88 of the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL on economic information disclosure1.\nThe data processing, analysis and reporting are conducted with the assistance of the ACE Working Group, which comprises representatives from participating ANSPs, airspace users, regulatory authorities and the Performance Review Unit. This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and data limitations.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2022 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the final ACE benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2024. Economic information disclosure by ANSPs takes time as it is depending on the publication of their audited financial statements, which can be a lengthy process. This document also presents specific financial indicators, extracted from the ANSPs Financial Indicators Dashboard, that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe final ACE benchmarking report will provide more detailed information on observed changes for selected performance indicators both at pan-European system level and at ANSP level. This detailed analysis will particularly focus on ANSPs for which significant differences in costs are observed. The report will present the main drivers underlying these differences.\nIn addition, a new theme will be developed, examining the potential impact of different regulatory, institutional, and corporate governance setups on ANSPs economic performance. While acknowledging that there are many different factors influencing the conduct of organisations (see the ACE Handbook for a comprehensive overview of endogenous and exogenous factors affecting performance), the forthcoming ACE report will provide new analysis considering differences in the legal status, ownership, and decision-making arrangements among ANSPs.\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the timeline to produce the next ACE benchmarking report.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Timeline to produce the next ACE benchmarking report\n\n\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible.\nSeventeen out of 38 ANSPs submitted their ACE 2022 data on time by the 1st of July 2023 and, all data submissions were received by the end of August 2023. Overall, this constitutes a major improvement compared to previous years. Clearly, the timescale to produce the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. Indeed, the data submission milestone is just the first step of a process which comprises a thorough verification and analysis of individual ANSP submissions. This validation exercise also includes a formal round of exchange between the PRU and each ANSP in order to ensure a common understanding of the data submitted by the ANSP.\nThe data used in this document reflects the information stored in the ACE database on the 5th November 2023. Figure 1.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbcontrol(Albania)\nDCAC Cyprus ✔️(Cyprus)\nHASP ✔️(Greece)\nM-NAV(North Macedonia)\nROMATSA ✔️(Romania)\n\n\nANS CR ✔️(Czech Republic)\nDFS ✔️(Germany)\nHungaroControl(Hungary)\nMOLDATSA ✔️(Moldova)\nSakaeronavigatsia ✔️(Georgia)\n\n\nARMATS(Armenia)\nDHMI ✔️(Türkiye)\nIAA ✔️(Ireland)\nMUAC(EUROCONTROL)\nskeyes(Belgium)\n\n\nAustro Control ✔️(Austria)\nDSNA ✔️(France)\nLFV(Sweden)\nNATS (Continental) ✔️(United Kingdom)\nSkyguide(Switzerland)\n\n\nAvinor (Continental) ✔️(Norway)\nEANS(Estonia)\nLGS ✔️(Latvia)\nNAV Portugal (Continental) ✔️(Portugal)\nSlovenia Control ✔️(Slovenia)\n\n\nBHANSA ✔️(Bosnia and Herzegovina)\nENAIRE ✔️(Spain)\nLPS(Slovakia)\nNAVIAIR(Denmark)\nSMATSA(Serbia/Montenegro)\n\n\nBULATSA(Bulgaria)\nENAV ✔️(Italy)\nLVNL(Netherlands)\nOro Navigacija(Lithuania)\n\n\n\nCroatia Control(Croatia)\nFintraffic ANS(Finland)\nMATS(Malta)\nPANSA(Poland)\n\n\n\n\n✔️ Data submission has been reviewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Status of 2022 data validation process\n\n\n\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE 2022 benchmarking report in May 2024.\nThe remainder of this report is structured as follows:\n\n\nChapter 2: provides a high-level presentation of 2022 revenues, costs and staff data.\n\nChapter 3: presents a preliminary analysis of economic cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\nChapter 4: presents a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level, and underlying components.\n\nChapter 5: presents a preliminary analysis of specific financial indicators at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the on-going war in Ukraine, UkSATSE has been excluded from the ACE analysis.↩︎",

    "text": "This chapter provides a preliminary overview of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2022 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2022 amounted to €9 024M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (95.9%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (68.3%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (21.3%) through, for example, a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn-route\n%\nGate-togate revenues (€ M)\n%\nTerminal\n\n\n\n6 928\n95.9%\nIncome from charges\n68.3%\n1 229\n\n\nn.a.\nn.a.\nIncome from airport operators\n21.3%\n383\n\n\n1.0\n0.01%\nIncome from the military\n0.04%\n0.7\n\n\n63\n0.9%\nIncome in respect of exempted flights\n2.9%\n51\n\n\n62\n0.9%\nIncome from domestic goverment\n4.1%\n75\n\n\n122\n1.7%\nFinancial income\n2.1%\n38\n\n\n49\n0.7%\nOther income (incl. exceptional revenue item)\n1.2%\n22\n\n\n7 224\n100%\n\n100%\n1 800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Breakdown of gate-to-gate ANS revenues, 2022\n\n\n::: blue :::: {layout=“[0.25, 0.5, 0.25]”} ::::: {#firstcol}  :::::\n\n\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2022 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +58.3% higher than in 2021 but remained -13.3% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased slightly less than traffic (+55.3%) and remained -14.9% lower than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n:::: :::\n\nAt ANSP level, a wide range of recovery rates is observed, ranging from -51% to +14% (see (Traffic_map?)). The war in Ukraine also resulted in airspace closures and reciprocal sanctions on air carriers which impacted traffic flows in Europe. This inevitably impacts the levels and trends of ACE indicators for the ANSPs being most affected by the changes in traffic patterns.\n\n\nChanges in composite flight-hours between 2019 and 2022\n\nThe ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €8 921M in 2022. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented around 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn-route\nTerminal\nGate-to-gate\n\n\n€ M\n%\n€ M\n%\n€ M\n%\n\n\n\n\nStaff costs\n4 550\n65.2%\n1 275\n65.4%\n5 825\n65.3%\n\n\nATCOs in OPS employment costs\n2 229\nn.a.\n631\nn.a.\n2 859\nn.a.\n\n\nOther staff employment costs\n2 321\nn.a.\n644\nn.a.\n2 965\nn.a.\n\n\nNon-staff operating costs\n1 155\n16.6%\n332\n17.0%\n1 487\n16.7%\n\n\nDepreciation costs\n702\n10.1%\n172\n8.9%\n875\n9.8%\n\n\nCost of capital\n453\n6.5%\n129\n6.6%\n582\n6.5%\n\n\nExceptional items\n113\n1.6%\n40\n2.0%\n152\n1.7%\n\n\nTotal ATM/CNS provision costs\n6 973\n100.0%\n1 948\n100.0%\n8 921\n100.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\n\n::: blue :::: {layout=“[0.35, 0.65]”}\n\n\nAfter two years of consecutive decreases, total ATM/CNS provision costs rose by +3.4% (+€296.8M) in 2022, reflecting cost increases for 26 out of 38 ANSPs. Non-staff operating costs (+€118.8M) and the cost of capital (+€115.7M) were the main sources of increase in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n:::: :::\n\nFor non-staff operating costs, this mainly reflects the fact that 2021 ANSPs cost-bases were affected by the temporary measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration, postponement of non-essential activities, etc.).  The observed trend in the cost of capital is heavily affected by very large increases for DHMI, DFS and LFV.\n\n\nIn 2022, the five largest ANSPs (DFS, DSNA, ENAIRE, ENAV and NATS) bore some 53% of the total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure 2.2).\n\nTrends in ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs (real terms)\n\n\n\nThe Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 52 497 staff in 2022 (comprising 51 680 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 817 internal MET staff). Some 17 142 staff (33%) were ATCOs working on operational duties, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%). On average, 2.0 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Breakdown of total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level, 2022\n\n\nIn 2022, the number of ATM/CNS staff was slightly lower than in 2021 (-0.9% or -473 FTEs).\n\nTrends in gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff at Pan-European system level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category\n\n\n\nThe overall change in staff numbers observed for 2022 mainly reflects changes in the following staff categories:\n\nAdministrative staff (-357 FTEs, or -4.1%);\nATCOs in OPS (+356 FTEs, or +2.1%); and,\nATCOs on other duties (-215 FTEs or -8.7%).\n\nTo some extent, the changes observed for the ATCOs categories may reflect the fact that some ATCOs previously reported as “on other duties” following the traffic decrease in 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are now re-allocated to OPS duties.\nDecreases are also observed for technical support staff for operational maintenance (-1.7%), OPS support staff (-2.0%), ab-initio trainees (-7.6%), ATC assistants (-3.1%), technical support staff for planning and development (-1.2%) an other staff (-0.2%). Conversely, the number of on-the job trainees (+8.9%) and staff for ancillary services (+2.2%) rose in 2022.",

    "text": "The concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour. This economic performance indicator is meant to capture trade‐offs between quality of service provided and costs1.\nFigure 3.1 shows preliminary results on the changes in economic cost-effectiveness over 2017 - 2022 at Pan-European system level. Figure 3.1 (a) shows the changes in unit economic costs, while Figure 3.1 (b) provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays. Unit economic costs significantly reduced in 2022 (-21.0%). This reduction results from the combination of a decrease in ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight-hour (-34.7%) and a large increase in the unit cost of ATFM delays (+325.3%). Despite this large increase, 2022 unit costs remain +5.0% higher than in 2019.\nIn 2022, ATFM delays increased almost six-fold to some 19.3M minutes. As a result, the share of ATFM delays in the 2022 unit economic costs amounts to 20%. This is close to the level reached in 2019, which was a year marked by significant capacity issues in several ANSPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Trend of unit economic costs at Pan-European system level, 2017-2022 (real terms)\n\n\nFigure 3.2 shows preliminary results at ANSP level (dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles, €411 and €635, respectively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Economic gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness, 2022 \n\n\nFor ten ANSPs ATFM delays represented more than 20% of their unit economic costs (see ANSPs with the largest red and lime portions, e.g. ANS CR, DFS, SMATSA, HungaroControl, etc.). In absolute terms (cumulative ATFM delays in minutes), DFS, DSNA, ENAIRE, NAV Portugal and NATS were the ANSPs generating the highest levels of ATFM delays in 2022 (70% of the pan-European system total ATFM delays). For some of these ANSPs, work associated with the implementation of new ATM systems caused a temporary reduction of the available capacity and as a consequence contributed to increase ATFM delays (this was for example the case for DSNA and NAV Portugal). Other ANSPs, for example PANSA, were affected by airspace closure due to extended monitoring activities performed by the military at the border with Ukraine, due to the ongoing war therein.\nFurther analysis of the relationship between changes in ANSPs costs, traffic and unit costs will be analysed in detail in the forthcoming ACE report.\n\n\n\n\nSee https://ansperformance.eu/economics/ace/ace-handbook/ for more information on the methodology used to compute composite flight-hours and economic costs.↩︎",

    "text": "The ACE benchmarking work is commissioned by the Performance Review Commission (PRC) and carried out by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) using information provided by Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in compliance with Decision No. 88 of the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL on economic information disclosure1.\nThe data processing, analysis and reporting are conducted with the assistance of the ACE Working Group, which comprises representatives from participating ANSPs, airspace users, regulatory authorities and the Performance Review Unit. This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and limitations of the data.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2021 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the ACE 2021 benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2023 It also presents specific financial indicators that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial examination of ANSPs capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021 is also provided.\nFigure Figure 1.1 illustrates the timeline for the production of the ACE 2021 benchmarking report.\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Timeline for the production of the ACE 2021 benchmarking report\n\n\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible\nEighteen ANSPs provided their ACE 2021 data submission on time by the 1st July 2022 and, in total, 23 data submissions were received by the 15th July 2022. For 10 ANSPs (Avinor, BULATSA, DCAC Cyprus, Fintraffic ANS, HASP, LVNL, MATS, Oro Navigacija, ROMATSA and Sakaeronavigatsia) the ACE data submissions were received more than one month after the deadline. Clearly, the timescale for the production of the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. These data reflect the information stored in the ACE database on the 17th November 2022 Figure Figure 1.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✔️Data submission has been reviewed\n\nFigure 1.2: Status of 2021 data validation process\n\n\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE 2021 benchmarking report in May 2023.\nThe remainder of this report is organised as follows:\n\n\nChapter 2: provides a high-level presentation of 2021 revenues, costs and staff data;\n\nChapter 3: presents a preliminary analysis of economic cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level;\n\nChapter 4: presents a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level, and underlying components.\n\nChapter 5: presents a preliminary analysis of specific financial indicators at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\nChapter 6: presents a preliminary analysis of capital expenditure trends at Pan-European level.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the war in Ukraine, UkSATSE was not able to provide ACE 2021 data. UkSATSE is therefore excluded from the ACE 2021 analysis. On the other hand, BHANSA, the ANSP operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, joined in ACE project in 2021. BHANSA data for the years 2020 and 2021 are therefore included in the ACE 2021 analysis. .↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This section provides a preliminary presentation of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2021 data submissions. Total ANS revenues in 2021 amounted to €5 410M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (93.2%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (56.1%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (28.5% e.g. through a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown of gate-to-gate ANS revenues, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2021 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +27.2% higher than in 2020 but remained -44.9% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased less than traffic (+20.8%) and remained -44.3% lower than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACE benchmarking analysis focuses on the specific costs of providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services which amounted to €7 937M in 2021. Operating costs (including staff costs, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items) accounted for some 84% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, while depreciation costs and the cost of capital represented some 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs at Pan-European system level, 2021\n\n\nIn 2021, the five largest ANSPs (ENAIRE, ENAV, DFS, DSNA and NATS) bore some 56% of total Pan-European gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs, while the five smallest ANSPs accounted for some 1% (see bottom left part of Figure 2.2).\n\n\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, total ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -4.9% (-€408.4M), reflecting cost reductions from 27 out of 38 ANSPs. When considering the savings already achieved in 2020, the cumulative decrease since 2019 is -8.8% (-€765M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff costs were by far the main source of savings in 2021 (-€221.4M). This reflects both the effect of temporary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 (e.g. short time work, furlough schemes, reduced remuneration…) but also the effect of redundancy plans.\n\nA majority of ANSPs also maintained lower level of non-staff operating costs or reduced it further in 2021 leading to a decrease of -€102.4M. Similarly, the cancellation or deferral of non-essential investments resulted in further reduction in depreciation costs (-€42.3M). Exceptional costs decreased by -€94.4M in 2021 mainly reflecting the fact that this cost item was particularly high in 2020 due to the reporting of redundancy costs. The only cost item increasing in 2021 was the cost of capital (+€52.2M), mainly due to large increases for DHMI and NATS, reflecting increases in their asset base and weighted average cost of capital. :::\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, 2016-2021 (real terms)\n\n\nThe Pan-European ANSPs employed a total of 53 014 staff in 2021 (comprising 52 164 staff providing ATM/CNS services and 850 internal MET staff). Some 16 781 staff (32%) were ATCOs working on operational duty, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%). On average, 3.1 additional staff are required for every ATCO in OPS in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Total gate-to-gate ATM/CNS staff per staff category and changes, 2020-2021\n\n\nIn 2021, the number of ATM/CNS staff fell by -1.5% (-796 FTEs) compared to 2020. The lower staff number observed for 2021 mainly reflects decreases in the following staff categories: • Administrative staff (-338 FTEs, or -3.7%); • ATCOs in OPS (-201 FTEs, or 1.2%); • Ab-initio trainees (-126 FTEs, or 12.5%); and • Technical support staff for operational maintenance, monitoring and control (-102 FTEs, or -1.2%). On the other hand, increase is observed for ATCOs on other duties (+154 FTEs) reflecting a reallocation of some ATCOs from operational to non-operational duties due to the relatively low traffic levels in 2021 compared to pre-crisis. Minor increases are also observed for staff for ancillary services (+14 FTEs) and other staff (+25 FTEs).\n\nIn addition to the measures on staff costs already mentioned above (redundancies, short-time work / furlough schemes), it is important to note that during the lockdown periods, some ANSPs staff had to consume accumulated holidays not used in previous years and/or made use of pre-retirement schemes."

    "text": "The concept of economic cost-effectiveness, developed by the PRC, is defined as the sum of gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ground ATFM delays for both en‐route and airport, all expressed per composite flight-hour.

Figure 3.1 (a) shows the changes in unit economic costs, while ?fig-figure-3-1-right provides complementary information on the year-on-year changes in ATM/CNS provision costs, composite flight-hours and unit costs of ATFM delays.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1:  Trend of unit economic costs at Pan-European system level, 2016-2021 (real terms)\n\n\nFigure 3.2 shows preliminary results at ANSP level (dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles). On average, the share of ATFM delays in 2021 was some 4% (compared to 3% in 2020 and 22% in 2019), and only four ANSPs had ATFM delays representing 5% or more of their unit economic costs: HASP (32%), NAV Portugal (8%), DSNA (7%) and LVNL (5%)\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Economic gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee https://ansperformance.eu/economics/ace/ace-handbook/ for more information on the methodology used to compute composite flight-hours and economic costs..↩︎"

This is the result of higher traffic in 2021 compared to 2020 (+27.2%) combined with lower ATM/CNS provision costs (-4.9%). On the other hand, 2021 unit ATM/CNS provision costs remain +65.7% higher than in 2019. This mainly reflects the fact that, despite a reduced cost-base (-8.8% compared to 2019) traffic volumes in 2021 were still significantly lower than in 2019 (-44.9%).\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2016-2021 (real terms)\n\n\nThe analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.60 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€125); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€454).\n\n\nFigure 4.2: ACE performance framework, 2021 (real terms)\n\n\nFigure 4.2 shows that in 2021, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour fell by -8.5% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +24.8%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-26.7%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -24.5% due to the combination of an increase in composite flight-hours (+27.2%) and a reduction in support costs (-4.0%).

In the meantime, the share of long-term liabilities rose by a +11 percentage points as several ANSPs contracted new loans or drew down from existing loan facilities in order to respond to liquidity issues and continue invest in priority projects.

    "section": "\n5.3 Cash flow indicators calculated from ANSPs financial statements",
    "text": "5.3 Cash flow indicators calculated from ANSPs financial statements\nFree cash flow is an indicator widely used by other aviation industry stakeholders. Here it is presented at an organisational level, based on the information reported in ANSPs’ financial statements. Depending on the organisational set up of ANSPs, this information may cover a wider scope of activities than the scope reported in the ACE submissions for “Total ANS”. In the case of DFS, the financial reporting standards used to establish route charges and for ACE reporting (regulatory accounting) are also different from the reporting standards used in DFS financial statements (IFRS).\nThe free cash flow to revenues ratio provides a representation of the cash generated by operations (after accounting for capital investments) which is available to repay creditors or pay dividends and interests to investors. It can therefore be broken down in two elements: a) the net cash from operating activities and b) the capital expenditures (CAPEX). Dividing these ratios by revenues allows an easier interpretation of the indicators when looking at organisations of different size.\n\n\nFigure 5.3: 2019-2020 trends in free cash flow to revenues ratio at ANSP level\n\n\nFigure 5.3 shows the 2019-2020 changes in free cash flow to revenues ratio (and its components) at ANSP level for 24 ANSPs for which data is publically available at the time of writing this report4.\nWhereas 15 of these ANSPs had a positive ratio in 2019, all ANSPs analysed (with the exception of Albcontrol) have a negative ratio in 2020. Although changes in the free cash flow are mainly driven by changes in the net cash flow from operating activities (see middle chart in Figure 5.3), it is interesting to note that when the free cash flow was negative in 2019, it was in several cases due to relatively large capital expenditures during the year (e.g. in 2019, Sakaeronavigatsia and LGS respectively invested 37% and 29% of their revenues).\nMore detailed analysis of changes in the free cash flow to revenues ratio will be provided in the ACE 2020 benchmarking report.\n\n\nThe analysis of ANSPs indicators shows that the situation deteriorated on several criteria:\n\nThe ability to cover short-term debt by using current assets was reduced by almost one third compared to the 2015-2019 period (current ratio falling from 3.6 to 2.6).\nCash reserves at the end of 2020 were sufficient to cover 136 days of operating expenses (34 days less than over the 2015-2019 period). When interpreting this indicator, it is important to consider the fact that loans contracted but not fully used in 2020 appear as cash in the balance sheet.\nThe equity ratio was around 0.4 at the end of 2020, which is lower than the 0.5 measured over the 2015-2019 period. This reduction results from the combination of a) lower capital reserves due to losses incurred in 2020 and b) the increase in borrowings.\n\nBased on a sample of 24 ANSPs, the net cash flow from operating activities in 2020 became negative (-€1.5 billion compared to €2.0 billion in 2020). When also considering the cash outflow for capital expenditures, the free cash flow amounted to -€2.2 billion in 2020."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This section provides a preliminary analysis of capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021 compared with their historical levels and looks at contextual elements such as traffic, ATFM delays and staffing. Although the relationship between these elements is not straightforward, with many factors affecting the quality of service provided by ANSPs, it is important to consider the situation in which ANSPs were operating at the time of making investment decisions.\nFigure 6.1 shows that, on average, capex across the 2011-2019 period was €1.1 billion per year, with less spent in the first part of the period (€1.0 billion 2011-2014) and more in the second part (€1.2 billion 2015-2019). After a -27.1% drop in 2020 compared to 2019, capex rose by +5.8% in 2021, but, overall, remained -5.3% below the 2011-2019 average.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Capital expenditures (2011-2021)\n\n\nSeveral factors could explain this overall reduction, including local sanitary measures, liquidity issues, availability of internal resources, availability of suppliers, etc. However, the situation at individual ANSP level is contrasted, and some ANSPs invested significantly more in 2020 and 2021 than in the preceding decade. More details will be provided in the forthcoming ACE report.\nFigure 6.2 and Figure 6.3 below provide an overview of the context in which the capital expenditures were made. Traffic grew consistently from 2013, so that by 2019 ANSPs were handling + 19% more composite flight-hours than at the start of the period, leading to a marked deterioration in the quality of service, especially in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Evolution of traffic, ATCO hours on duty and ATFM delays (2011-2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Evolution of ATCOs in OPS, ATCOs on other duty and ab-initio trainees (2011-2021)\n\n\nIn the meantime, the number of ATCO-hours on duty remained largely stable between 2011 and 2019, despite a slight increase in the number of ATCOs in OPS. The combined acceleration of capital expenditures and recruitment of ab-initio trainees over the 2016-2019 period shows that overall, some decisions were made to adapt to the rising traffic demand. However, there is a time lag which can extend to several years between the decision to invest or recruit ab-initio trainees and the actual commissioning of capex projects or staff intake. The forthcoming ACE 2021 benchmarking report will include a more detailed analysis of capex cycles at individual ANSP level."

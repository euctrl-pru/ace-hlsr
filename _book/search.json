    "text": "The ACE benchmarking work is commissioned by the Performance Review Commission (PRC) and carried out by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) using information provided by Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in compliance with Decision No. 88 of the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL on economic information disclosure.\nThe data processing, analysis and reporting are conducted with the assistance of the ACE Working Group, which comprises representatives from participating ANSPs, airspace users, regulatory authorities and the Performance Review Unit. This enables participants to share experiences and establish a common understanding of underlying assumptions and data limitations.\nThe objective of this document is to provide a first insight on the level of 2023 cost-effectiveness performance both for the Pan-European system and for individual ANSPs before the release of the final ACE benchmarking report, which is planned end of May 2025. This document also presents financial indicators extracted from the ANSPs Financial Indicators Dashboard and monitoring ANSPs’ cash holdings and liquidity.\nEconomic information disclosure by ANSPs takes time as it is depending on the publication of their financial statements, which can be a lengthy process. Indeed, ANSPs have to follow official procedures that prevent them from sharing their financial statements before the independent audit report is finalised and the formal approval for publication is received by the relevant authorities (sometimes at Ministry level).\nThe final ACE benchmarking report will provide more detailed information on observed changes for selected performance indicators both at pan-European system level and at ANSP level. This detailed analysis will particularly focus on ANSPs for which significant differences in costs are observed. The report will present the main drivers underlying these differences.\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the timeline to produce the next ACE benchmarking report.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Timeline to produce the next ACE benchmarking report\n\n\nIt is important that robust ACE benchmarking analysis is available in a timely manner since several stakeholders, most notably ANSPs’ management, regulatory authorities (e.g. NSAs) and airspace users, have a keen interest in receiving the information in the ACE reports as early as possible.\nFifteen out of 38 ANSPs submitted their ACE 2023 data on time by the 1st of July 2024 and all data submissions were received by early September 2024. For ANSPs operating under Single European Sky regulations, the ACE data submission process was carried out at the same time as the preparation of performance plans for the 4th Reference Period (RP4) covering 2025-2029. However, clearly the timescale to produce the ACE benchmarking report is inevitably delayed if data are not submitted on time.\nIt should be noted that the data presented in this document are still preliminary and not yet fully validated. Indeed, the data submission milestone is just the first step of a process which comprises a thorough verification and analysis of individual ANSP submissions. This validation exercise also includes a formal round of exchange between the PRU and each ANSP in order to ensure a common understanding of the data submitted by the ANSP.\nThe data used in this document reflects the information stored in the ACE database on the 12th of November 2024. Figure 1.2 shows the status of the ACE data validation process for the data presented in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirnav Ireland(Ireland)\nCroatia Control ✔️(Croatia)\nFintraffic ANS ✔️(Finland)\nMATS(Malta)\nROMATSA(Romania)\n\n\nAlbcontrol(Albania)\nDCAC Cyprus ✔️(Cyprus)\nHASP ✔️(Greece)\nMOLDATSA(Moldova)\nSakaeronavigatsia ✔️(Georgia)\n\n\nANS CR ✔️(Czech Republic)\nDFS ✔️(Germany)\nHungaroControl ✔️(Hungary)\nMUAC ✔️(EUROCONTROL)\nskeyes(Belgium)\n\n\nARMATS ✔️(Armenia)\nDHMI ✔️(Türkiye)\nLFV ✔️(Sweden)\nNATS (Continental) ✔️(United Kingdom)\nSkyguide ✔️(Switzerland)\n\n\nAustro Control ✔️(Austria)\nDSNA(France)\nLGS ✔️(Latvia)\nNAV Portugal (Continental)(Portugal)\nSlovenia Control(Slovenia)\n\n\nAvinor (Continental)(Norway)\nEANS(Estonia)\nLPS(Slovakia)\nNAVIAIR ✔️(Denmark)\nSMATSA(Serbia/Montenegro)\n\n\nBHANSA ✔️(Bosnia and Herzegovina)\nENAIRE ✔️(Spain)\nLVNL(Netherlands)\nOro Navigacija ✔️(Lithuania)\nROMATSA(Romania)\n\n\nBULATSA(Bulgaria)\nENAV ✔️(Italy)\nM-NAV ✔️(North Macedonia)\nPANSA(Poland)\nSakaeronavigatsia ✔️(Georgia)\n\n\n\n✔️ Data submission has been reviewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Status of 2023 data validation process\n\n\nThe data contained in this report is therefore subject to changes before the release of the final ACE 2023 benchmarking report in May 2025.\nThe remainder of this report is structured as follows:\n\n\nChapter 2: provides a high-level presentation of 2023 revenues, costs, staff and balance sheet data.\n\nChapter 3: presents a preliminary analysis of economic cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level.\n\nChapter 4: presents a preliminary analysis of financial cost-effectiveness at Pan-European and ANSP level, and underlying components.\n\nChapter 5: presents a preliminary analysis of specific financial indicators at Pan-European level.",

    "text": "2.1 Revenues and traffic\nThis chapter provides a preliminary overview of high-level revenues, costs and staff data provided in ANSPs ACE 2023 data submissions.\nTotal ANS revenues in 2023 amounted to €10 784M. Most en-route revenues come from the collection of en-route charges (95.4%, see left pie chart). The proportion of terminal revenues from charges is lower (72.1%, see right pie chart), as additional income may directly come from airport operators (18.1%) through, for example, a contractual arrangement between the ANSP and the airport operator.\nAcross the Pan-European system, traffic in 2023 (measured in composite flight-hours) was +11.0% higher than in 2022 but remained -3.7% lower than in 2019. In the meantime, total gate-to-gate revenues increased slightly more than traffic (+12.9%, or +€1 229M) and remained -3.8% lower than in 2019.\nAt ANSP level, traffic in 2023 recovered to varying degrees from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (see Figure 2.3). At the higher end, composite flight-hours were +63% and +38% above 2019 levels for Sakaeronavigatsia and Albcontrol respectively. While at the lower end, traffic remained -43% and -39% below 2019 levels for MOLDATSA and LGS respectively. The war in Ukraine continued to cause airspace closures and reciprocal sanctions on air carriers, which impacted traffic flows in Europe. This inevitably impacted the levels and trends of ACE indicators for the most affected ANSPs.\nLooking forward, the recent EUROCONTROL Seven-Year Forecast shows that traffic may remain below pre-pandemic levels until at least 2025.",

A rise in staff costs (+€309M) was the main source of the increase in 2023, with six ANSPs accounting for 76% of the overall change in staff costs (ENAIRE, DHMI, LFV, Skyguide, ROMATSA and NAV Portugal).

Some 17 368 staff (33%) were ATCOs working on operational duties, split between ACCs (55%) and APP/TWR facilities (45%).

The highest proportional increase (+5.0%) was in ab-initio trainees, suggesting that some ANSPs increased recruitment of trainees for ATCO positions in 2023.\nCompared to 2019, the number of ATCOs in OPS was +0.7% higher in 2023, while the number of support staff was -2.5% lower. The overall reduction in support staff was mainly driven by a -6.6% decrease in administrative staff (-600 FTEs), partly compensated by an +25.0% increase in the number of on-the-job trainees (+240 FTEs).",

This is the result of traffic increase (+11.0%) being partly offset by growth of ATM/CNS provision costs (+2.9%).\nUnit ATM/CNS provision costs in 2023 returned to the level of financial cost-effectiveness achieved in 2019, itself the lowest unit cost achieved since the inception of the ACE benchmarking in 2002.\nThe analytical framework used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.88 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€133); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€319).\nFigure 4.3 shows that in 2023, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour rose by +2.2% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +9.0% compared to 2022. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-6.3%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -7.8% due to an increase in composite flight-hours (+11.0%) being partly offset by an increase in support costs (+2.3%). Consequently, in 2023, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -7.3% at the Pan-European system level compared to 2022, taking into account the relative weighting of ATCO employment and support costs based on their shares of total ATM/CNS provision costs.\nAs the values of the 2022 indicators were affected by the persistent consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, Figure 4.4 below provides an additional analysis using 2019 as a reference year. It shows that in 2023 traffic was still -3.7% below its 2019 level. However, an equivalent reduction in total support costs (-3.8%) means that unit support costs in 2023 were all but level with 2019 (-0.1%). ATCO employment costs were also very close to their 2019 value (+0.6%) as both employment costs per ATCO-hour and ATCO-hour productivity remained marginally below pre-pandemic levels (-0.3% and -0.9% respectively). Overall, the unit cost in 2023 was +0.1% higher than in 2019.",

    "text": "This chapter provides an overview of ANSPs’ financial situation over the 2018-2023 period, using two indicators: the current ratio and the cash-on-hand days. These indicators have been calculated at pan-European system level using the information provided in the ANSPs’ Financial Statements which were available at the time of publishing this report (35 for the 2018-2022 period and 27 in 2023). The indicators are therefore consistent with those published at individual ANSP level in the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Unit ANSPs Financial Dashboard.\nDepending on the organisational set up of different ANSPs, the information reported in their financial statements covers a different scope of activities (e.g. it may include airport management operations, commercial activities, etc.) which does not always correspond with the ACE gate-to-gate scope. Additionally, due to specific organisational and financial set up, DCAC Cyprus, HASP, LVNL and MUAC, are excluded from the analysis presented in this chapter.\nFigure 5.1 presents the changes in the average current ratio between 2018 and 2023 as well as the 1st and 3rd quartiles. The current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term debt obligations with its current assets.\nFigure 5.1 shows that the average current ratio for ANSPs declined from 2018 to a low point in 2021, due to pandemic related revenue drops, but has since improved, reaching 3.82 in 2023. This recovery reflects an overall strengthening of liquidity across the sector, yet there is substantial variability in financial resilience. Both the 1st and the 3rd quartiles have increased in 2023, however, while the former reached a level in line with that observed in 2018, the latter remains lower than pre-crisis levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Trends in ANSPs current ratio 2018 - 2023\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2018 - 2023 period as well as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. The cash-on-hand days indicator (cash & cash equivalents divided by operating costs x 365) measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: 2018 - 2023 trends in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level\n\n\nFigure 5.2 illustrates that while the average has increased to 140 days in 2023 (up from 135 days in 2022), it remains below pre-pandemic levels. This gradual recovery indicates improved liquidity for many ANSPs, yet there is a clear disparity between those with stronger and weaker liquidity positions.\nMore detailed analysis on these financial indicators will be available in the forthcoming ACE report.",

    "text": "4.1 Pan-European system level\nFigure 4.1 shows that in 2022 the unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -25.2% compared to 2021. This is the result of higher traffic in 2022 compared to 2021 (+27.2%) combined with lower ATM/CNS provision costs (-xxxxxxxxxx%).\nOn the other hand, 2022 unit ATM/CNS provision costs remain +65.7% higher than in 2020. This mainly reflects the fact that, despite a reduced cost-base (-8.8% compared to 2020) traffic volumes in 2022 were still significantly lower than in 2020 (-44.9%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2017 – 2022 (real terms)\n\nThe analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in Figure 4.2. These key drivers include:\na) ATCO-hour productivity (0.60 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);\nb) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€125); and,\nc) support costs per unit output (€454).\n\n\nFigure 4.2: ACE performance framework, 2022 (real terms)\n\nFigure 4.3 shows that in 2022, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour fell by -8.5% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +24.8%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-26.7%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -24.5% due to the combination of an increase in composite flight-hours (+27.2%) and a reduction in support costs (-4.0%). As a result, in 2021, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -25.2% at Pan-European system level.\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Breakdown of changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, 2021 – 2022 (real terms)"

In all these figures, the dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles.\nThere are three main elements to be considered when interpreting the level of the indicators as well as ANSPs rankings in the figures below: a) the traffic level in 2022 was still significantly lower than before COVID-19 crisis (although being lower for all ANSPs, the gap is not completely homogeneous), b) there were different responses in cost adjustments in 2021 and 2022, and c) there were also different levels of flexibility in adjusting the workforce, and in particular ATCO in OPS hours on duty, which has an enormous impact on the ATCO productivity and employment costs indicators measured in the ACE report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Financial gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: ATCO-hour productivity, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Employment costs per ATCO-hour, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Breakdown of support costs per composite flight-hour, 2022\n\nA more detailed analysis of the changes in cost-effectiveness, ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs will be available in the final ACE 2022 benchmarking report."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter provides a preliminary analysis of specific indicators that can be used to monitor potential cash and liquidity issues experienced by ANSPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and 2022. Due to specific organisational and financial set up in HASP, LVNL and MUAC, these three ANSPs are excluded from the analysis presented in this chapter.\nFigure 5.1 presents the changes in ANSPs balance sheet structure as reported in their ACE data submissions at “Total ANS” level (i.e. en-route, terminal and other ANS). The scope is therefore wider than gate-to-gate ATM/CNS which is used to calculate the other ACE key performance indicators, but depending on what ANSPs include under “Other ANS”, it might not necessarily match with the whole activities of the ANSP.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Changes in ANSPs balance sheet structure (2019-2022)\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows capital and reserves increased by +4.2% in 2022 but remained -€778M lower than in 2019. In the meantime, short and long term borrowings continued to increase (+33.5% in 2022), reaching €5 900M, which is three times higher than in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Changes in ANSPs capital and reserves and borrowing, 2019-2022 (real terms)\n\n\nIn order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on the ANS industry, the PRC uses indicators aiming at monitoring ANSPs financial situation. For more details on how these indicators have been defined for the purposes of this analysis, along with their limitations, please refer to Section 4.2 of the ACE 2020 report.\nFigure 5.3 shows the changes in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level over the 2016-2021 period as well as the 1st quartile and the 3rd quartile of these indicators. Cash-on-hand days measures the length of time a company can pay its operating costs from its cash reserves.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: 2016-2022 trends in cash-on-hand days at Pan-European system level\n\n\nIn 2021, the average cash-on-hand days amounted to 105 days, which is -32 days (or -23%) lower than in 2020 and -62 days (or -37%) lower than over the 2016-2019 period."

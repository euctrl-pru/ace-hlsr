# Financial cost-effectiveness {#sec-financial}

This section provides a [preliminary analysis]{.underline} of financial cost-effectiveness.

## Pan-European system level {#sec-fin_1}

@fig-figure-4-1 shows that in `r year_report` the unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -25.2% compared to `r year_report-1`. This is the result of higher traffic in `r year_report` compared to `r year_report-1` (+27.2%) combined with lower ATM/CNS provision costs (-4.9%).

On the other hand, `r year_report` unit ATM/CNS provision costs remain +65.7% higher than in `r year_report-2`. This mainly reflects the fact that, despite a reduced cost-base (-8.8% compared to `r year_report-2`) traffic volumes in `r year_report` were still significantly lower than in `r year_report-2` (-44.9%).

Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, `r year_report-5`-`r year_report` (real terms)

The analytical framework which is used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in @fig-figure-4-2. These key drivers include:

a\) ATCO-hour productivity (0.60 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);

b\) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€125); and,

c\) support costs per unit output (€454).

![ACE performance framework, `r year_report` (real terms)](figures/Figure-4-2.png){#fig-figure-4-2 width="100%"}

@fig-figure-4-2 shows that in `r year_report`, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour fell by -8.5% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +24.8%. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-26.7%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -24.5% due to the combination of an increase in composite flight-hours (+27.2%) and a reduction in support costs (-4.0%). As a result, in 2021, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -25.2% at Pan-European system level.

## ANSP level {#sec-fin_2}

@fig-figure-4-4 to @fig-figure-4-7 present the main ACE key performance indicators at ANSP level for the year `r year_report`. In all these figures, the dotted lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles.

There are three main elements to be considered when interpreting the level of the indicators as well as ANSPs rankings in the figures below: a) the traffic level in `r year_report` was still significantly lower than before COVID-19 crisis (although being lower for all ANSPs, the gap is not completely homogeneous), b) there were different responses in cost adjustments in `r year_report-1` and `r year_report`, and c) there were also different levels of flexibility in adjusting the workforce, and in particular ATCO in OPS hours on duty, which has an enormous impact on the ATCO productivity and employment costs indicators measured in the ACE report.

A more detailed analysis of the changes in cost-effectiveness, ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs will be available in the final ACE `r year_report` benchmarking report.

# Financial cost-effectiveness {#sec-financial}

This chapter provides a [preliminary analysis]{.underline} of financial cost-effectiveness.

## Pan-European system level {#sec-fin_1}

@fig-figure-4-1 shows that in {{< var doc.year_report >}} the unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -7.3% compared to 2022, reaching an amount of €460. This is the result of traffic increase (+11.0%) being partly offset by growth of ATM/CNS provision costs (+2.9%).

Unit ATM/CNS provision costs in 2023 returned to the level of financial cost-effectiveness achieved in 2019, itself the lowest unit cost achieved since the inception of the ACE benchmarking in 2002.

Changes in unit ATM/CNS provision costs, {{< var doc.year_report_minus5 >}} -- {{< var doc.year_report >}} (real terms)
:::

The analytical framework used in the ACE analysis to break down the financial cost-effectiveness indicator into relevant economic drivers is presented in @fig-figure-4-2. These key drivers include:

a\) ATCO-hour productivity (0.97 composite flight-hours per ATCO-hour);

b\) ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour (€144); and,

c\) support costs per unit output (€311).

@fig-figure-4-3 shows that in {{< var doc.year_report >}}, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour rose by +2.2% while ATCO-hour productivity rose by +9.0% compared to 2022. As a result, ATCO employment costs per composite flight-hour decreased (-6.3%). In the meantime, unit support costs fell by -7.8% due to an increase in composite flight-hours (+11.0%) being partly offset by an increase in support costs (+2.3%). Consequently, in 2023, unit ATM/CNS provision costs fell by -7.3% at the Pan-European system level compared to 2022, taking into account the relative weighting of ATCO employment and support costs based on their shares of total ATM/CNS provision costs.

As the values of the 2022 indicators were affected by the persistent consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, @fig-figure-4-3-2 below provides an additional analysis using 2019 as a reference year. It shows that in 2023 traffic was still -3.7% below its 2019 level. However, an equivalent reduction in total support costs (-3.8%) means that unit support costs in 2023 were all but level with 2019 (-0.1%). ATCO employment costs were also very close to their 2019 value (+0.6%) as both employment costs per ATCO-hour and ATCO-hour productivity remained marginally below pre-pandemic levels (-0.3% and -0.9% respectively). Overall, the unit cost in 2023 was +0.1% higher than in 2019.

## ANSP level {#sec-fin_2}

All figures presented in this section present the preliminary benchmarking results for the 38 ANSPs. Because of their weight in the Pan-European system, the six largest ANSPs by cost (DFS, DHMI, DSNA, ENAIRE, ENAV and NATS) are also shown in a miniature replica of the chart (top right corner of the figures). Compared to previous years’ report, DHMI is now part of this group since its share in the total Pan-European system costs is now reaching 7%, which is close to ENAV and NATS shares. The 1^st^ and 3^rd^ quartiles for each indicator are also shown in all figures. The gap between these two quartiles provides additional insight on the dispersion of the values.

@fig-figure-4-4 presents the financial gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness indicator at ANSP level for the year {{< var doc.year_report >}}. The dotted lines represent the 1^st^ and 3^rd^ quartiles (€`r q1_4_4` and €`r q3_4_4`, respectively).
